\section*{Short Answer}
What is the process of creating a bash script (steps taken to make one):
\begin{solution}
The first thing you must do is create the file you would like to turn into a script.

\verb' touch Script.sh'

You must then add a heading to the file to tell your OS what type of interperator to use for the script. we are going to use bash

\verb' #! bin bash' 

You then write the script

\verb' *insert hacker script here*'

Once the script is written you want to make sure it is runnable. The easier way to do that is to do the following command 

\verb' chmod +x Script.sh'

or

\verb' chmod 777 Script.sh' 

You now can run the script using the following command 

\verb' ./Script.sh' 

That is how you create a bash script. 
\end{solution}
